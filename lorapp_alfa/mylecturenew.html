                        <p><strong>REVOLUTION: SOMETHING LOST AND SOMETHING FOUND</strong></p>

                        <p>Powered by a chain reaction of ideas and innovations, a revolution of industry swept the western hemisphere in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In a relatively short time, we discovered ways to transform mined materials into manufacturing devices, transportation systems, and agricultural tools that fueled the twentieth century’s explosive innovations. Inventions like the cotton gin, machine tools, the steam engine, the telegraph, and the telephone promised a future filled with opportunity and prosperity.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Though the industrial revolution sprang from a utopian vision of human progress, humans were so often the ones left behind. Skilled craftsmen like blacksmiths, cobblers, tin-smiths, weavers, and many others slowly forfeited their trade to factories that could produce goods faster and at a lower cost. As the machine found its place in our world, the human hand’s presence in everyday objects slowly faded.</p>

                        <p>But some challenged the blind march toward progress. As mass production expanded in the mid-nineteenth century, the Arts and Crafts movement sought to preserve the craftsman’s role in domestic goods production, and with it the human touch. The founders of the Arts and Crafts movement revered the things they designed, built, and used every day. They recognized that a craftsman leaves a bit of themselves in their work, a true gift that can be enjoyed for many years.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>In the present day, we can see a few parallels. In a quest for higher crop yields and lower production costs, farms have become headless corporations pitting profits against human welfare. But local farmers are finding new markets as consumers search for food produced by people for people. While big-box stores proliferate disposable mass-market goods, websites like Etsy and Kickstarter are empowering artists, craftspeople, and DIY inventors who sell goods they’ve designed and created. And their customers love the experience. When you buy from an independent craftsman, you support creative thinking and families (not corporations), and you gain the opportunity to live with an object that has a story. That feels good.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>We web designers find ourselves in a similar situation.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>There’s plenty of opportunity to build fast and cheap sites with no reverence for craft or the relationship we build with our audience. We could create new projects with stock photography, boilerplate templates, and one-size-fits-all copy. We could reduce our industry to a commodities race, like those who manufactured the industrial revolution. There is a market for that kind of work.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Or we could follow a different path, one paved by the artists, designers, and architects of the Arts and Crafts movement, who believed that preserving the human touch and showing ourselves in our work isn’t optional. It’s <em>essential</em>.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>I’m delighted to report that many on the web are already on this path. I’ll guide you through examples of the principles that emotional design visionaries use not only to build a human connection with their audience, but also to fuel their success. There’s a common thread through these principles—emotional design—which uses psychology and craftsmanship to create an experience for users that makes them feel like there’s a person, not a machine, at the other end of the connection.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>It’s taken our medium time to mature to where we can begin exploring emotional design and talking to our audience with a new voice. Once upon a time, on a web not so unlike the one we enjoy today, we spoke much differently because we hadn’t yet learned to be ourselves. We were still trying to be the machine.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>THE WAY WE WERE</strong></p>

                        <p>The web had a rocky start in building emotional connections.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>It gets gold stars for connecting people in far-off lands, but the necessities of academia were the mother of its inventions—a dry origin indeed. As business pioneers discovered new watering holes, the web quickly became a breeding ground of dot-com bubble thinking. I remember writing copy for my personal website in the late 1990s using the royal “we,” trying to create the perception that I was a big company when the guy behind those words was in his bedroom in smelly pajamas trying to figure out HTML. I wasn’t trying to be me—I was trying to be like the other big players out there.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>But something happened to that trend in the middle of the naughts. All of those people who were laid off or fired after the dot-com bubble burst either started new companies or re-treated to their bedrooms and stayed in pajamas to make new websites and applications.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Maybe it was because a boss wasn’t standing over their shoulder, or maybe they needed to do something to lift their spirits, but the voice of these new sites was decidedly more personal.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>During this period, Flickr launched with the famously familiar and endearing copy that puts smiles on so many faces.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Facebook and Twitter surfaced and influenced the voice of the web. These new social tools allowed users to share the minutiae of daily life. That may not sound terribly profound, but it represents a major change in the way that we communicate on the web. Whereas professionalism might have buttoned down our communiqués before social networks, today conversations are often more true to the way that we’d speak to friends. Of course, a little moderation is sometimes in order (I’m looking at you, Rainn Wilson, http://bkaprt.com/de/1; <strong>fig 1.1</strong>).&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><img alt="FIG 1.1: Dear Rainn Wilson, TMI." src="http://beta.lorapp.com/alfa/lorapp/public/attachment/get/view/50/2635a71c12a09787060400564b69aca1"></p>

                        <p>The curtain has been drawn back, exposing our humor, grumpiness, concern, stress, and all the other emotions that season our days. As we’ll see in Chapter 3, this honesty is creeping into the personalities we craft for our businesses, and our users are beginning to expect the websites and web applications they visit to reflect a personality that they can relate to.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>This book is chock-full of examples of a design sensibility that is distinctly human, individual, reflective of a real personality, and honest—all while keeping business goals in mind. You might have some trepidation about how to implement emotional design techniques without boiling your boss’s blood. We’ll see practical, real-world examples designed to inspire and support your case for employing emotional design in your next project. I’ll even share a bevy of data to help you make an empirical case for emotional design.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><img alt="fig 1.2: Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs." src="http://beta.lorapp.com/alfa/lorapp/public/attachment/get/view/51/52098acf98234705a46969e610c0a9ae"></p>

                        <p>Keep in mind that ignoring human needs is not a history we are doomed to repeat. Through our designs, we can see and connect with other human beings.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>So where do we start? Well, like any good user experience designer, we begin by understanding the needs of the people we’re designing for.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>HELLO, MASLOW</strong></p>

                        <p>In the 1950s and 60s, the American psychologist Abraham Maslow discovered something that we all knew but had yet to put into words: no matter our age, gender, race, or station in life, we all have basic needs that must be met. Maslow illustrated his ideas in a pyramid he called the Hierarchy of Needs (<strong>fig 1.2</strong>).&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Maslow stressed that the physiological needs at the base of this hierarchy must be met first. The need to breathe, eat, sleep, and answer the call of nature trump all other needs in our life. From there, we need a sense of safety. We can’t be happy if we fear bodily harm, loss of family, property, or a job. Next, we need a sense of belonging. We need to feel loved and intimately connected to other humans. This helps us get to the next level: a sense of self, a respect for others, and the confidence we need to excel in life. At the top of Maslow’s pyramid is a broad, but important category—self-actualization.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Once all other needs are met, we can fulfill our need to be creative, to solve problems, and to follow a moral code to serve others.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Maslow’s approach to identifying human needs can help us understand our goals when designing interfaces. We could certainly live contented lives meeting only the bottom three strata of the needs pyramid—physiological comfort, safety, and belonging. But it’s in that top layer that we can live a truly fulfilled life.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Interface design is design for humans. What if we translated Maslow’s model of human needs into the needs of our users? It might look something like this (<strong>fig 1.3</strong>):</p>

                        <p><img alt="fig 1.3: We can remap maslow’s Hierarchy of needs to the needs of our users." src="http://beta.lorapp.com/alfa/lorapp/public/attachment/get/view/52/7342a9ee85725bc22ac76510af00f0f0"></p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>GETTING THE BASICS RIGHT</strong></p>

                        <p>For a user’s needs to be met, <em>an interface must be functional. </em>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>If the user can’t complete a task, they certainly won’t spend much time with an application. Remember when Apple released Ping? It was their attempt at building a social network around your iTunes music library. It was a pretty big flop, in part because you couldn’t share a song with friends on Twitter or Facebook. After users learned that the new system lacked basic features, most didn’t return.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;<em>The interface must be reliable.&nbsp;</em> There was a stretch of time when early Twitter adopters learned to hate the “fail whale,”&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>shown when the server was down or over capacity. If the web server drops out intermittently, or the service is otherwise unreliable, a user will leave.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;<em>An interface must be usable.&nbsp;</em> It should be relatively easy to learn to perform basic tasks quickly, without a lot of relearning. Ever tried to book a flight online? If you have, I’d bet a five spot that expletives tripped across your tongue while each page loaded. You’re not alone. Fortunately, Hipmunk (http://hipmunk.com) is setting a new bar for online travel booking.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Historically, usability has been the zenith of interface design. Isn’t that a bit depressing? If you can make a usable interface, you’re doing well in our industry. Imagine if we used that stick to measure success in the auto industry. By that standard, we’d be swooning over the 1978 AMC Pacer.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Many websites and applications are creating an even better experience. They’re redrawing the hierarchy of needs to include a new top tier with pleasure, fun, joy, and delight. What if an interface could help you complete a critical task and put a smile on your face? Well, that would be powerful indeed!&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>That would be an experience you’d recommend to a friend; that would be an idea worth spreading.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>We need a new yardstick to measure the success of our designs. We can transcend usability to create truly extraordinary experiences.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><img alt="fig 1.4: Basecamp, a project management web application." src="http://beta.lorapp.com/alfa/lorapp/public/attachment/get/view/53/b22c55caa1cc0919637206a9d883d4fe"></p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>USABLE = EDIBLE</strong></p>

                        <p>If you’re working on the web, chances are you’ve used 37Signals’ handy project management app Basecamp (http://basecamphq.com) (<strong>fig 1.4</strong>).&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>In building Basecamp, 37Signals’ design ethos centered around simplicity and usability. Their design ideas, summed up in <em>Getting Real</em> (http://bkaprt.com/de/2) inspired a generation of web pros to keep designs simple and make sure tasks are easy to complete.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>37Signals helped us tackle the bottom of the needs pyramid. With a zeal for simplicity and spartan design, they create eminently functional, reliable, and usable web apps. Despite user requests for new features or changes to the workflow, Basecamp has remained true to its original vision. That’s both a strength and a weakness. With few major changes over the years, the interface is predictable, usable, and requires almost no relearning. But an interface that doesn’t evolve risks losing touch with user needs. The same is true of design thinking.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Though the 37Signals design ethos guided us in the infancy of our medium, the landscape of the web and our relationship to it has changed. Simple and usable is great, but there’s still more we can achieve. We must bring web design back into the realm of delight.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Think back to the best meal you’ve ever had. Not a good meal, I mean a mind-blowing, palate-challenging, fall-in-love-with-food-again, great meal. What made it so memorable?&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Was it the taste and texture of the food? Was it the unexpected pairing of flavors? Was it the artful presentation, attentive wait staff, and ambiance? Chances are, many of these factors worked in concert to elicit an intense emotional response.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Now think about this. Did you once think about the meal’s nutritional value? I doubt it (if you did, you need to get out a little more). Though the meal met your body’s needs, the immense pleasure of the experience formed the memory in your brain, one which you will carry for a long time.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Why don’t we aim for a similar target in web design? We’ve been designing usable interfaces, which is like a chef cooking edible food. Certainly we all want to eat edible foods with nutritional value, but we also crave flavor. Why do we settle for usable when we can make interfaces both usable and pleasurable?&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Well, Wufoo isn’t settling. They’re making their usable interface fun.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>Wufoo: more than usable</strong></p>

                        <p>Wufoo (http://wufoo.com/), a popular web app that helps people build forms and connect them to databases, has emotional design baked right into the interface (<strong>fig 1.5</strong>). Like Basecamp, Wufoo serves a utilitarian purpose. Its users want to perform tasks quickly. Making databases and designing forms can be tricky and intimidating if you’re not very technical. But Wufoo makes it easy and, unlike most of its competitors, they make it fun.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><img alt="fig 1.5: Wufoo, a form building web app that is more than usable, it’s fun!" src="http://beta.lorapp.com/alfa/lorapp/public/attachment/get/view/54/ce2254c65e1ecbe2e0f99dc6d2d01a97"></p>

                        <p>Wufoo keeps task flows simple and focused with uncluttered interfaces. Though the app offers powerful features, it strikes a healthy balance by not including obscure functionality that might confuse the majority of users while serving a niche audience. With millions of users creating bajillions of forms, it’s fair to say that Wufoo is reliable. Like Basecamp, it’s doing a heck of a job staying functional, reliable, and usable for a big audience.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>But there’s one big, big difference with Wufoo’s user experience: personality. Spend a couple of minutes in the app, and you’ll get a sense for the people who made the application. It shines through in the copy. “O, what men dare do!” greets me at the top of the Form Builder dashboard, a hat tip to William Shakespeare. And again, in the sample copy atop a fresh form awaiting customization, “This is my form. Please fill it out. It’s awesome!” Note the primary colors on each page; sans-serif typefaces chat in familiar, informal tones. There aren’t many hard edges here. Corner radii are generous, creating a cartoony feel. Even if you’ve never met the guys who made this app, you know what makes them tick when you log into your account. Their voice and perspective comes through in their designs. Wufoo is a piece of software, but it feels like a living, breathing human being.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Kevin Hale, the user experience design lead and co-founder of Wufoo, considered the emotional state of Wufoo users when conceptualizing the design.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><em>The inspiration for our color palette came from our competitors.&nbsp;</em></p>

                        <p><em>It was really depressing to see so much software designed to</em> <em>remind people they’re making databases in a windowless office,</em> <em>and so we immediately knew we wanted to go in the opposite</em> <em>direction.&nbsp;</em></p>

                        <p>In his mind, Kevin had an emotional portrait of the people he was designing for. They’re “people in a windowless office,”&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>probably under the thumb of a boss who needs them to collect information. They’re on deadline and uninspired by their day-to-day work. With a clear personality in the application that says it’s okay to have a little fun at work, he’s delivering warmth to thousands of cold, gray cubicles. That’s something people won’t forget, and for good reason.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>There’s craftsmanship in Wufoo, but I’m not referring just to the technical construction. A craftsman wields great technical skill, and shows us their hand in their work. Their work exudes a human quality we can see and feel. We could list the design elements that work in concert in Wufoo to construct a personality that users can relate to, but the sum is greater than its parts. As we’ll see in Chapter 4, Wufoo uses emotional engagement to create lasting impressions with their customers.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>There’s actually some science behind what they’re doing, too.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>It turns out emotion and memory are closely linked.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>EMOTION AND MEMORY</strong></p>

                        <p>Emotional experiences make a profound imprint on our long-term memory. We generate emotion and record memories in the limbic system, a collection of glands and structures in the brain’s foldy gray matter. In his book <em>Brain Rules,&nbsp;</em> molecular biologist John Medina shares the science behind the relationship between emotion and memory:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>&nbsp;<em>Emotionally charged events persist much longer in our memories</em> <em>and are recalled with greater accuracy than neutral memories.&nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;<em>How does this work in our brains? It involves the prefrontal</em> <em>cortex, the uniquely human part of the brain that governs&nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;<em>“executive functions” such as problem-solving, maintaining</em> <em>attention, and inhibiting emotional impulses. If the prefrontal</em> <em>cortex is the board chairman, the cingulate gyrus is its personal</em> <em>assistant. The assistant provides the chairman with certain</em> <em>filtering functions and assists in teleconferencing with other</em> <em>parts of the brain—especially the amygdala, which helps create</em> <em>and maintain emotions. The amygdala is chock-full of the</em> <em>neurotransmitter dopamine, and it uses dopamine the way an</em> <em>office assistant uses Post-It notes. When the brain detects an</em> <em>emotionally charged event, the amygdala releases dopamine</em> <em>into the system. Because dopamine greatly aids memory and</em> <em>information processing, you could say the Post-It note reads&nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;<em>“Remember this!” Getting the brain to put a chemical Post-It</em> <em>note on a given piece of information means that information is</em> <em>going to be more robustly processed. It is what every teacher,</em> <em>parent, and ad executive wants.&nbsp;</em></p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Add us designers to that list too, Dr. Medina!&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>There’s a very practical reason that emotion and memory are so closely coupled—it keeps us alive. We would be doomed to repeat negative experiences and wouldn’t be able to consciously repeat positive experiences if we had no memory of them. Imagine eating a delicious four-pound log of bacon and not having the sense to eat another the following day. That’s a life not worth living, my friend.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>As babies, we build an emotional bond with our parents when we cry and our parents offer food, a fresh diaper, or a loving touch. Our parents’ response triggers the limbic system to release calming neurotransmitters. As this cycle repeats, we begin to trust that our parents will respond again when we need them, and we form an emotional bond.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>A similar feedback loop happens in interface design.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Positive emotional stimuli can be disarming. It builds engagement with your users, which can make the design experience feel like a chat with a friend or a trusted confidant. Although the fun design and language in Wufoo’s interface may seem like window dressing, it’s actually a clever brain hack. It’s a powerful way to build a positive memory, which increases the chance that Wufoo’s users will continue to use and trust the application.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>As we’ll soon see, many websites and web apps are arriving at the same conclusion. They’re realizing that more people sign up for their service, stay on their site, and buy more stuff if they transcend usable to create a pleasurable experience.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Designing for emotion is good for business. So says Chris Lindland, CEO of Betabrand (http://betabrand.com), proprietors of fashion wrapped in whip-smart <em>Onion-</em> esque humor (<strong>fig 1.6</strong>). Betabrand has about thirty minutes of reading material plus a generous gallery of amateur action heros putting their togs to the test. That’s a lot of content. Lindland actually describes Betabrand as an online magazine that happens to sell clothes. In the end, clothes are simply the artifacts of the amazing experience customers have on their site. When you wear a pair of Betabrand’s Cordaround pants, not only do you enjoy a “22% lower crotch heat index,” and a “16.24% lower drag coefficient,” you also remember that you’re part of a select group who’ve discovered this modern marvel of science and fashion.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>There’s a fun story behind every product, and Lindland knows that making people feel good can translate into sales and marketing budget savings.&nbsp;</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>&nbsp;<em>News of fun products and experiences travel far and wide online</em> <em>and at absolutely no cost. It tips people from “Maybe” to “Why</em> <em>the hell not?” Folks sense potential energy in products that are</em> <em>fun to talk about.</em></p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p><img alt="fig 1.6: Betabrand see themselves as an online magazine that happens to sell clothing. oh, and they can lower the drag coefficient of your crotch by an amazing 16.24%." src="http://beta.lorapp.com/alfa/lorapp/public/attachment/get/view/55/a1ce6a4280fa2a281afcae70961b9f35"></p>

                        <p>We’ll explore the relationship between emotional design and return on investment (ROI) in Chapter 7, and even see some hard numbers. Before we get to the data, let’s look at the design principle behind Betabrand’s success.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>THE EMOTIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE</strong></p>

                        <p>They may not know it, but Betabrand has the emotional design principle at the heart of their business. When you start your next design project, keep this principle in mind: people will forgive shortcomings, follow your lead, and sing your praises if you reward them with positive emotion.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>To engage your audience emotionally, you must let your brand’s personality show. In the examples we’ve seen in Wufoo and Betabrand, personality is unmistakable. When you present your brand’s personality clearly, your audience can relate to it as if it were just another human. It creates empathy and helps your audience see a better version of themselves.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Humans want to connect with real people. We forget that businesses are just collections of people—so why not let that shine through?&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Emotional design turns casual users into fanatics ready to tell others about their positive experience. It also offers a trust safety net that encourages your audience to stay when things go awry. Again, Chris Lindland of Betabrand reinforces this idea with a story about a customer we’ll call the Pink Panther from Portland.&nbsp;</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>&nbsp;<em>A customer in Portland learned of a Cordarounds sale 10 days</em> <em>after buying a pair and wrote to ask for a discount. He told me</em> <em>companies like Nordstom offer such rebates, and I asked if a one-man online business should be held to the same standards of a</em> <em>multi-billion dollar biz with thousands of employees.&nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;<em>Our disagreement was following a predictable path until I</em> <em>realized there was no holy way in hell he’d ever buy anything</em> <em>from us again, so I proposed a wager—if his Portland Trailblazers</em> <em>could defeat the lowly Clippers, not only would he get a discount</em> <em>but a pink pair of pants. If I won, I’d give him a discount and he’d</em> <em>have to tell two people that he’s now a consultant for Betabrand.&nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;<em>He tuned into the game with his wife, listened as the</em> <em>Trailblazers won, and earned himself a prized pair of Pink</em> <em>Panthers.&nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;<em>To this very day, he remains one of our greatest, most loyal</em> <em>customers. Why? Because he found something that’s better than</em> <em>customer service—fun customer experience.&nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;<em>In addition to this, our greatest customer also became an</em> <em>investor in our company.</em></p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>The Pink Panther had a bad start with Betabrand, and Lindland could have done what most of use would have: tell the guy to go fish. But Lindland changed the tone by talking to the Panther like a friend. He won a lifelong customer and an investor by staying true to his company’s personality.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Emotional design isn’t just about copy, photos, or design style: it’s a different way to think about how you communicate.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Certainly, emotional design has risks. If emotional engagement compromises the functionality, reliability, or usability of an interface, the positive experience you wanted will mutate into a rant-inducing disaster for your users. A friendly wager with an upset customer isn’t always going to turn the tide.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>We’ll have a candid discussion about the pitfalls of emotional design and how to avoid them. But before we do, I’ll help you understand the firmware that powers the human perspective, as it’s the framework for the strategies you’ll craft in your next project.</p>
